# What is sharding?

## Answer

MongoDB stores flexible BSON documents and is most effective when documents mirror the data retrieved together. Model for access patterns, index every important query, and use transactions only where cross-document consistency is required.

## Example

Consider a production MongoDB change: define the expected behavior and failure modes first, implement the smallest observable change, then verify it with a focused test or measurement. The right implementation depends on the system boundary and its constraints.


## Practical considerations

1. Choose the approach from the requirement and constraints, not from habit.
2. Include validation, error handling, and cleanup where the boundary requires them.
3. Verify the observable result with focused tests or measurement.

## In practice

For this easy-level topic, make assumptions explicit, choose the smallest safe implementation, and verify the behavior at the relevant boundary.
