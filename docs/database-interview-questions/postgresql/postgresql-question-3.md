# How do PostgreSQL indexes work?

## Answer

PostgreSQL is a feature-rich relational database with strong transactions, MVCC concurrency, extensible types, and mature indexing. Use constraints to protect invariants and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to tune observed slow queries.

## Example

Consider a production PostgreSQL change: define the expected behavior and failure modes first, implement the smallest observable change, then verify it with a focused test or measurement. The right implementation depends on the system boundary and its constraints.


## Practical considerations

1. Choose the approach from the requirement and constraints, not from habit.
2. Include validation, error handling, and cleanup where the boundary requires them.
3. Verify the observable result with focused tests or measurement.

## In practice

For this easy-level topic, make assumptions explicit, choose the smallest safe implementation, and verify the behavior at the relevant boundary.
